//Here we are going to input the routes so our code is little bit more tided up! This routes are going to be the ones that are gonna control what is going to happen
//in the route, however, for the actual logic we are going to work it out on the controllers folder.

// 1) First we are going to import express and express.Router so we can use it to create our routes



// 2) Import the controllers so we can use it later on in the routes to give them functionality (for that first go to controllers and lets create the functions 
// that are gonna have the logic of the methods we are gonna input in the routes, although you can leave them blank for the time been).


// 3) After that we can start creating the routes. For that, so we can chaine the different methods we are going to use (get, post, etc) that have the same route together
// lets use .route() 


// 4) Lastly, don't forget to export the router so we can use it in wishlist.js
